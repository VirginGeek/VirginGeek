- 👋 Hi, I’m @VirginGeek
- 👀 I’m interested in finishing the development on a BOT I have been working on for nearly eight years.
- 🌱 I have no background in software development but since my involvement with project. I have learnt to use excel but apart from that, everything else is way above my head.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a person to collaborate with me on this project. The person I am looking for must have extensive knowledge of C# and API comunication systems. They will also need a considerable amount of patience, as I am a seventy-one year old fart.
- 📫 I can be reached in the first instance by sending me an email at: npk@manx.net
